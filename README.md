# BenchName Baselines

## What is BenchName? 

[**BenchName**](https://huggingface.co/collections/icmlbenchname/icml-25-benchname-679b57e38a389f054cdf33e9) is a suite of benchmarks for code-related tasks with large contexts, up to a whole code repository.
It currently spans six different tasks and contains six datasets:
* ðŸ¤— [Library-based code generation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/icmlbenchname/library-based-code-generation)
* ðŸ¤— [CI builds repair](https://huggingface.co/datasets/icmlbenchname/ci-builds-repair)
* ðŸ¤— [Project-level code completion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/icmlbenchname/project-level-code-completion)
* ðŸ¤— [Commit message generation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/icmlbenchname/commit-message-generation)
* ðŸ¤— [Bug localization](https://huggingface.co/datasets/icmlbenchname/bug-localization)
* ðŸ¤— [Module summarization](https://huggingface.co/datasets/icmlbenchname/module-summarization)

## Where are the baselines? 

For each task, we have different approaches and environments. You can find the baseline solutions and the necessary information about each task in the corresponding directories. 

## How can I submit my results? 

We are excited to invite you to participate in solving our benchmarks!
